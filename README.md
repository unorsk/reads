## 2023

* Rafa, mi historia (Spanish Edition) by John Carlin
* Blood and Oil - Mohammed bin Salman's Ruthless Quest for Global Power by Bradley Hope, Justin Scheck ★★★★☆ It's well written, but once in a while a had difficulties keeping track of all the Samlans and Mohammeds – too many people having same names. The book gives a very good perspective on modern Saudi Arabia's politics.
* Den vedervärdige mannen från Säffle by Sjöwall Wahlöö ★★★★☆ (This is my first book a read in Swedish - an easy to read crime fiction)
* El otro yo by Rafael Caunedo (read 2/3 didn't finish) ★★☆☆☆
* Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology, by Chris Miller ★★★★★
* Dead in the Water: A True Story of Hijacking, Murder, and a Global Maritime Conspiracy by Kit Chellel and Matthew Campbell ★★★☆☆ (it was nice, just could be 10 times shorter)
